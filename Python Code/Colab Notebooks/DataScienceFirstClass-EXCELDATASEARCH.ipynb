Taking deep breathes coughing sneezing moving or being touched in this area worsens the pain. Frequently, nausea and vomiting accompany these symptoms, with the pain becoming persistent and well-localized. Other symptoms may include diarrhea, abdominal swelling (in late stages), mild fever (usually less than 102 F), an elevated white blood cell count, constipation, inability to pass gas, painful urination, and bood in the urine.\n","24:     If pain follows an injury or sudden movement, apply ice for the first forty-eight hours, and then apply heat. Rest on a firm bed. Soak in a very warm bath or apply a heating pad directly to your back, but do not put the heat too high. Rhus toxicodendron, a homeopathic remedy, is helpful in relieving stiffness. Take as directed. Doing exercises once acute pain has subsided to strengthen abdominal muscles may help prevent re-occurances. Sit ups are good. Learn to recognize and reduce stress. Activities that are good for the back include swimming, cycling, walking, and rowing. avoid sports. If you have pain in one side of the small of your back, feel sick, and have a fever, see your physician immediately. You may have a kidney infection Numerous studies have shown that people with lower back pain who are treated at chiropractic clinics recover faster, and at less cost, and end up with less pain then treated at hospitals\n","38:     Symptoms: engorgement- a temporary problem that most commonly occurs between two to five days after childbirth. It is caused by combination of increased blood supply to the breast and the pressure of the newly produced milk, resulting in the swelling of the tissues in the breast. A low grade fever may be present, the breast feel full, hard, tender, and tight, and the skin is hot, shiny, and distended. Mastitis (Breast infection)- If a plugged duct is not taken care of, mastitis can result. Soreness and redness in the breast, fever, yellow, pus-like secretions from the nipple, general tiredness, and flulike symptoms are indicators of this problem. Plugged duct- Soreness and a lump in the one area of the breast is an indication of this problem. Sore nipples- soreness of the nipple\n","39:     Symptoms- building of mucus, inflammation of broncial tubes, coughing, fever, pain in the chest and / or back, fatigue, sore throat, difficulty breath, and often, sudden chills and shaking.
