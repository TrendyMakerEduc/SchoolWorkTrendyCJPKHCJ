//        //Java has three iteration statement- while, do-while, and for
//        //while(expression) statement - repeats statement until expression becomes false, expression is always evaluated before statement, if false initally, statement will never be executed
//        //do statement while (expression)- where expression bust be of type boolean
//        //for (initialization; termination; increment) statement 1) initializtaion statement is executed once before the first iteration, termination expression is evaluated before each itertion to determine when the loop should terminate, increment statement is executed fter each iteration
//        //1) Initialization is executed once, terminiiation expression is evaluated, increment statement is executed, component statement is executed, control flow continues from the second semantic
//        //The for statment include declaration of a loop control variable
//        //for(int i= 0; i < 1000; i++){}
//        -structured oriented versus paradigm
//                -program design for java
//                *Classes (data members, constructors, methods)
//                *object/object instantiation (the new operator)
//                *accessing data members methods (the "." operator)
//                * the "this" operator
//                * constuctors: general stucture
//                * methods (member functions): general strcuture
//        -Virtues of paradigm design
//                * encapsulation (information hiding)
//                * Inheritance
//                * polymorphism

//        Java's programming paradigm
//        - strongly object-oriented
//        - object-orientation is the dominant programming paradigm
//        - replaced the structured-oriented paradigm (as in C)
//
//        Structure-oriented programming
//            - a program is a collection of procedures/functions
//                - each function performs a specific task
//                example: as in C or Pascal
//
//        object-oriented programming (cont)
//    - in procedural oriented programming- the data is shared between functions, in object design- data is encapsulated within classes, it can be shielded with private, public, default, and protected
//
//        data members are the variables, methods are the functions
//                abstract dont have an implementation, concrete does have implementation. abstract class cannot be instantiated
//
//        encapsulation
//        - a class in the static sense is a named fragment of code
//                Header: the keyword "class" followed by the class-name
//                Body: body is comprised of data and methods and is enclosed in { }
//                data can be shielded from access to other classes
//
//
//                to get a class to work it must be instantiated
//
//        public static void main and new classname();
//        static is class variable, and double is instance variable
//
//                a set is a grouping of objects, a class is a grouping of common concrete methods
//
//        instantiation is a memory allocation or assignment
//        main is the program entry point
//    }
